                <h3>13. Privacy Policy</h3>

                <p>
                    We respect your privacy. Among the types of Personal Data that

                    Failure or neglect by either party to exercise or enforce any
                    right conferred shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any such
                    right nor operate so as to bar that exercise or enforcement
                    thereof or of any other right on any later occasion.

                <h3>15. Severability</h3>

                    If any provision (or part of it) of these Terms is determined to
                    be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable, that provision, or part,
                    shall be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and
                    provisions which shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the
                    fullest extent permitted by law.

                <h3>16. Applicable Law</h3>

                    Northern Ireland you may also bring proceedings in Northern

                    proceedings in Scotland.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you are a business, these Terms, their subject matter and its
                    formation (and any non-contractual disputes or claims) are
                    governed by English law. You and We agree to the exclusive
                    jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
                </p>
